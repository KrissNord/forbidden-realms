# 🎉 What We Accomplished - M1 Partial (v0.2.0 in progress)

### Fully Implemented Features

**1. Complete Dialogue Tree System**
- Multi-node conversations with branching paths
- Player choices that affect conversation flow
- Natural conversation endings (empty choices array)
- Error handling for invalid input (try/except)
- Loop-based dialogue that follows `goes_to` paths

**YAML Structure:**
```yaml
name: NPC Name
dialogues:
  node_name:
    text: "What the NPC says"
    choices:
      - text: "Player choice 1"
        goes_to: next_node
      - text: "Player choice 2"
        goes_to: other_node
  next_node:
    text: "Follow-up dialogue"
    choices: []  # Empty = conversation ends
```

**Code Pattern:**
```python
current_node = "greeting"
while True:
    node_data = npcs[npc_id]["dialogues"][current_node]
    # Display text and choices
    if len(node_data["choices"]) == 0:
        break
    # Get player choice
    # Update current_node based on choice
```

**2. Rich Content - Two Detailed NPCs**
- **Guard Tom Broadshield**: Village guard with personality, backstory (guards spread thin, bandit troubles), multiple conversation paths, quest offer
- **Armorer Felix**: Friendly old-timer (30 years in village), low on stock, opinions about the rats, hints at dark magic
- Both NPCs reference each other and build world cohesion
- Multiple endings based on player choices

**3. Enhanced UI with Rich Panels**

**Compact Panel (entering locations):**
```
╭─────────── Village Entrance ───────────╮
│                                         │
│ A worn dirt path leads into the        │
│ village.                                │
│                                         │
│ People: Guard Tom                       │
│ Exits: north, east                      │
│                                         │
╰─────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

**Detailed Panel (look command):**
```
╭─────────── Village Entrance ───────────╮
│                                         │
│ [Full detailed description]             │
│                                         │
│ People here:                            │
│   • Guard Tom                           │
│                                         │
│ Items here:                             │

│                                         │
│ Exits:                                  │
│   • north → Town Square                 │
│   • east → Old Mill                     │
│                                         │
╰─────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

## 🧠 Python Concepts Learned (Session 2)

### New Concepts
- **While loops with changing state**: `current_node` variable that updates to follow dialogue paths
- **String building**: Concatenating strings with `+=` to build complex output
- **Try/except error handling**: Catching invalid input gracefully
- **List comprehensions**: `[npcs[npc]["name"] for npc in current_location["npcs"]]`
- **Dictionary .items()**: Looping through key-value pairs in exits
- **String manipulation**: `.replace("_", " ")` and `.join()`
- **Conditional logic in loops**: `if len(...) == 0: break`
- **Rich Panel API**: Creating bordered sections with titles

### Libraries/Modules Used
- `rich.panel.Panel`: Creating bordered content boxes
- Rich markup in strings: `[bold yellow]Text[/bold yellow]`
- String formatting with f-strings and nested data access

### Code Organization Patterns
- Building strings incrementally before displaying
- Wrapping repeated code in reusable patterns
- Consistent error handling across user input
- Conditional display sections (show only if data exists)

### Key Variables in main.py
- `current_node` - Tracks which dialogue node is currently displayed (string)
- `node_data` - Reference to current dialogue node data (dictionary)
- `content` - String built up for panel display
- `entry_content` - String for compact entry panel

### New Code Patterns

**Dialogue Loop Structure:**
```python
current_node = "greeting"
while True:
    node_data = npcs[npc_id]["dialogues"][current_node]
    
    # Display dialogue
    console.print(f"[bold yellow]{npcs[npc_id]['name']}:[/bold yellow]")
    console.print(f"[green]{node_data['text']}[/green]")
    
    # Display choices
    for index, choice in enumerate(node_data["choices"], start=1):
        console.print(f"[blue]{index}. {choice['text']}[/blue]")
    
    # Check if conversation ends
    if len(node_data["choices"]) == 0:
        break
    
    # Get player choice with error handling
    try:
        user_input = console.input("[bold cyan]Choose: [/]")
        choice_num = int(user_input)
        selected_choice = node_data["choices"][choice_num - 1]
        current_node = selected_choice["goes_to"]
    except:
        console.print("[red]Invalid choice. Try again.[/red]")
        continue
```

**Panel Building Pattern:**
```python
# Build content string
content = f"[style]{text}[/style]\n\n"
content += "[bold yellow]Section:[/bold yellow]\n"
for item in items:
    content += f"  • {item}\n"

# Wrap in panel
console.print(Panel(content, title="[bold cyan]Title[/bold cyan]", border_style="cyan"))
```

## 🚀 What's Next - Completing M1

### Immediate Priority: Quest System

**Why quests next?**
- Guard Tom already TALKS about a quest, but nothing tracks it
- Ties together dialogue choices with game progression
- Foundation for rewards (which need inventory)
- Natural next step from dialogue trees

### Quest System Requirements

**Quest Data Structure (YAML):**
```yaml
quest_id: rat_problem
name: "Rat Infestation"
description: "Clear the rats from the old mill."
giver: guard_tom  # NPC who gives the quest
stages:
  - id: not_started
    description: "Talk to Guard Tom about work."
  - id: active
    description: "Clear the rats from the mill."
  - id: completed
    description: "Return to Guard Tom for your reward."
rewards:
  gold: 50
  items:
    - minor_healing_potion
```

**Game State Tracking:**
```python
# Player's quest log
active_quests = {
    "rat_problem": {
        "stage": "active",
        "progress": {}  # Future: kill counts, items collected, etc.
    }
}
```

**What Needs Building:**
1. Quest YAML files in `data/quests/`
2. Quest loader (similar to locations/NPCs)
3. Quest acceptance (dialogue choice triggers quest start)
4. `quests` command to view active quests
5. Quest completion checking
6. Save/load quest state

## 🎓 Teaching Notes for Next Session

### Student Learning Style (Proven Effective)
1. **Concept explanation** (brief "what & why")
2. **Small isolated example** (2-3 lines demonstrating concept)
3. **Pose the challenge** ("How would we use this for quests?")
4. **Student attempts** implementation
5. **Guide with questions** if stuck (not full solutions)
6. **Test frequently** to catch bugs early

### Student Strengths
- ✅ Grasps nested data structures (dictionaries in dictionaries)
- ✅ Comfortable with loops and conditionals
- ✅ Good at pattern recognition (applying similar code to new problems)
- ✅ Motivated by narrative/character systems
- ✅ Enjoys seeing immediate playable results

### Concepts to Introduce for Quest System
- **Global game state**: Quest data that persists across commands
- **State machines**: Quest stages transitioning (not_started → active → completed)
- **Triggering events**: Dialogue choices affecting game state
- **Data validation**: Checking quest conditions before completion
- **UI formatting**: Displaying quest log cleanly

### Teaching Approach for Quests
1. Start with **simplest possible quest**: Accept → Complete (no intermediate steps)
2. Show how dialogue choice can set a flag: `active_quests["rat_problem"] = "active"`
3. Build `quests` command to display active quests
4. Add quest acceptance to Guard Tom's dialogue
5. Later: Add completion checking and rewards

### Potential Challenges
- **Global state management**: Quest data needs to be accessible across commands
- **Save/load expansion**: Adding quests to save file structure
- **Dialogue integration**: Making choices trigger quest state changes

### Success Criteria for Quest Milestone
- [ ] Can accept a quest from Guard Tom via dialogue
- [ ] `quests` command shows active quest with description
- [ ] Can manually "complete" quest (placeholder for now)
- [ ] Quest state persists in save file
- [ ] Clean panel display for quest log
