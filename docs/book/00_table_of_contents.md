---

### Chapter 7: Quest Systems - Giving Players Goals
- Quest structure (objectives, rewards, states)
- Triggering quests from dialogue
- Tracking quest progress
- Quest completion detection

**Concepts:** Complex data structures, state management, dictionaries within dictionaries

**Challenge:** Create a fetch quest (bring X items)
**Skeleton:** Quest tracking with TODOs

---

### Chapter 8: Inventory - Managing Items
- List operations (append, remove, in)
- Item lookup patterns
- State persistence (items in locations + player inventory)
- The "disappearing items" bug and how to fix it

**Concepts:** Lists, dictionaries, references vs copies, state management

**Challenge:** Implement the `use` command
**Skeleton:** `take` and `inventory` commands with TODOs for `use`

---

### Chapter 9: The Item System - YAML Data Files
- Creating a flexible item schema
- Loading items at startup
- Graceful fallbacks (what if item file is missing?)
- The `inspect` command

**Concepts:** Data-driven design, error handling, optional parameters

**Challenge:** Create 3 new items with effects
**Skeleton:** Item YAML template with TODOs

---

**Milestone 2 Checkpoint:** You now have NPCs, quests, and items!

---

## Part 3: Character Depth (M2)

### Chapter 10: Stats System - Numbers That Matter
- Primary stats (what they affect)
- Calculated stats (formulas from primary stats)
- Stat modifiers (race + class + background)
- The power of small numbers (balance)

**Concepts:** Arithmetic, formulas, functions with parameters

**Challenge:** Design your own secondary stat (e.g., dodge chance)
**Skeleton:** Player stat methods with TODOs

---

### Chapter 11: Character Creation Flow
- Sequential prompts
- Input validation patterns
- The try/except pattern for number input
- Looping until valid input

**Concepts:** Input validation, try/except, while loops, user experience

**Challenge:** YOU IMPLEMENT THIS (current session!)
**Skeleton:** Already created in character_creator.py

---

### Chapter 12: Races, Classes, Backgrounds
- Modular character building
- YAML-driven design choices
- Stat bonuses and starting items
- Balancing different playstyles

**Concepts:** Data-driven design, balance, player choice

**Challenge:** Create a new race with unique bonuses

## Book Philosophy

**What This Book IS:**
- A project-based learning experience
- Focused on understanding through building
- Challenging but supportive
- Building a REAL playable game

**What This Book IS NOT:**
- A reference manual
- A dump of complete solutions
- A passive reading experience
- Focused on memorization

## Next Steps

1. Write Chapter 1 together
2. Establish the chapter template
3. You write some sections, I guide
4. Build out chapters progressively
5. Test with other learners
6. Refine based on feedback

---

**Target Audience:**
- Beginners with basic Python (loops, functions, dictionaries)
- People who learn by doing
- Aspiring game developers
- Fans of text-based RPGs

**What makes this book different:**
- ACTUALLY makes you code (not just read)
- Teaches through mistakes and debugging
- Uses a real, fun project
- Respects the reader's ability to think
