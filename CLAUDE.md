# Teaching Style for This Project

## Student Context
- Learning Python with basic experience (loops, functions, dictionaries)
- Prefers explanation → example → hands-on practice
- Does NOT want full solutions shown upfront
- Motivated by narrative/character systems in game development

## Teaching Approach
1. Explain concepts briefly (what, why, when)
2. Show 2-3 line isolated examples
3. Pose the problem: "How would we use this for...?"
4. Let student attempt implementation
5. Guide with questions if stuck, not complete solutions
6. Use TODO comments and skeletons instead of full code

## Code Style
- Use type hints for clarity
- Prefer explicit over clever
- Comment "why" not "what"
- Keep functions small and focused

## Project Guidelines
- This is Forbidden Realms, a text-based RPG
- Following incremental roadmap (see full_roadmap.md in docs/)
- Always check and update summaries in docs/summaries/
- Currently in M1 (Dialogue & Quest system)
- Every milestone should produce a playable build
