  greeting:
    text: "Halt there, traveler! Tom Broadshield, village guard. State your business in Runewild Village - we've had... trouble lately, so I need to know who's coming and going."
    choices:
      - text: "Just passing through, no trouble from me."
        goes_to: passing_through
      - text: "I'm an adventurer looking for work."
        goes_to: work_inquiry
      - text: "What kind of trouble?"
        goes_to: trouble_explanation
  
  passing_through:
    text: "Fair enough. Just keep your nose clean while you're here, and we won't have any problems. The inn's got rooms if you need rest, and Felix's smithy is worth a visit if you need gear."
    choices:
      - text: "Wait, you mentioned trouble earlier?"
        goes_to: trouble_explanation
      - text: "Thanks for the directions."
        goes_to: friendly_farewell
  
  work_inquiry:
    text: "An adventurer, eh? Well, your timing couldn't be better. We've got a serious rat problem at the old mill - nasty critters, bigger and meaner than they should be. Been there about a month now, and it's hurting the village. We need grain from that mill."
    choices:
      - text: "I'll handle it. Where's the mill?"
        goes_to: quest_accept
      - text: "How bad could some rats be?"
        goes_to: rats_dangerous
      - text: "Rats aren't really my specialty..."
        goes_to: quest_decline
  
  trouble_explanation:
    text: "The old mill's been overrun. Started small - a few rats here and there. But now? Place is infested. We can't get our grain processed, and the miller's too scared to go back in. I've been trying to find someone brave enough to clear it out."
    choices:
      - text: "I can handle some rats. I'll do it."
        goes_to: quest_accept
      - text: "Why don't you guards take care of it?"
        goes_to: why_not_guards
      - text: "Sounds dangerous. I'll think about it."
        goes_to: neutral_farewell
  
  rats_dangerous:
    text: "Don't underestimate them, friend. These aren't normal rats - they're the size of small dogs, and they travel in packs. Lost a good man last week who went in there unprepared. Felix thinks there might be something... unnatural about them. Dark magic, maybe."
    choices:
      - text: "All the more reason someone needs to stop them. I'm in."
        goes_to: quest_accept
      - text: "Dark magic? That changes things... I'll pass."
        goes_to: quest_decline
  
  why_not_guards:
    text: "Fair question. Truth is, we're spread thin. I'm the only full-time guard in Runewild right now. The captain took most of the force north to deal with bandit troubles on the trade road. I can't abandon my post here to go rat-hunting, much as I'd like to."
    choices:
      - text: "Then I'll go in your place."
        goes_to: quest_accept
      - text: "Sounds like the village has bigger problems than rats."
        goes_to: bigger_picture
      - text: "I understand. Good luck finding someone."
        goes_to: neutral_farewell
  
  bigger_picture:
    text: "You're not wrong. Bandits, rats, strange happenings... feels like the whole region's on edge lately. But we deal with problems one at a time, and right now, that mill is choking the village. No grain means no bread. No bread means hungry people. Hungry people get desperate."
    choices:
      - text: "You've convinced me. I'll clear the mill."
        goes_to: quest_accept
      - text: "I hope you find someone to help."
        goes_to: neutral_farewell
  
  quest_accept:
    text: "Now that's what I like to hear! The mill's just east of the village square - can't miss it. Watch yourself in there, and don't go in alone if you can help it. Clear out the rats, and there's 50 gold in it for you, plus whatever you find in there. Good hunting!"
    choices: []
  
  quest_decline:
    text: "Scared of a few rats, are we? Ha! Can't say I blame you - they're nasty bastards. Well, if you change your mind, you know where to find me. Otherwise, move along. I've got a village to protect."
    choices: []
  
  friendly_farewell:
    text: "Safe travels, friend. Keep your wits about you out there."
    choices: []
  
  neutral_farewell:
    text: "Suit yourself. The offer stands if you change your mind. Gate's that way."
    choices: []
