  equipment_chat:
    text: "Normally I'd have a fine selection for you - swords, axes, good sturdy armor. But I'm afraid my stock's running low these days. That damn rat infestation at the mill has everyone on edge, and adventurers have been buying me out left and right!"

  village_info:
    text: "Runewild's a good place, been here since before most of these youngsters were born. We're a trading hub - caravans stop here on their way north to Frostholm. Quiet life, usually... except for recent troubles."

  rat_story:
    text: "The old mill's been overrun by rats - big ones too, not your usual vermin. Started about a month ago. Tom's been trying to find someone to clear them out, but most folk are too scared. Between you and me, I think there's something unnatural about those rats..."

      - text: "I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for the warning."
        goes_to: farewell
  
  unnatural_hint:
    text: "Just a hunch, mind you. But in my thirty years here, I've never seen rats that organized. They move in packs, almost like they're being... directed. Could be nothing, could be dark magic. Either way, be careful if you go poking around that mill."
