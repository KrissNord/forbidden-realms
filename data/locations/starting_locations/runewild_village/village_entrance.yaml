name: Village Entrance
short_description: A worn dirt path leads into the village.
detailed_description: >
  Two sturdy wooden posts mark the boundary of Runewild Village, their surfaces 
  weathered by countless seasons. A dirt path, rutted from wagon wheels and worn 
  smooth by travelers' boots, winds between them and into the heart of the settlement. 
  Guard Tom Broadshield stands his eternal watch here, eyes scanning each newcomer 
  with practiced vigilance. Beyond the posts, you can hear the distant sounds of 
  village life - the clang of Felix's hammer, merchants calling out their wares, 
  and the steady creak of the old mill wheel to the east. A wooden sign nailed to 
  one post reads "Runewild Village - Traders Welcome, Troublemakers Unwelcome."
